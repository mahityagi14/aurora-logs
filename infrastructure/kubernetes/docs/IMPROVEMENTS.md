# Kubernetes Folder Improvements Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. **Simplified File Structure**
- Renumbered all YAML files in logical deployment order (00-11)
- Removed duplicate files (`02-configmaps.yaml` old version, `08-processor.yaml` old version)
- Consolidated to use Fluent Bit-enabled versions as defaults

### 2. **Organized Files by Purpose**
- **Base Infrastructure** (00-03): Namespace, secrets, configs, storage
- **Services** (04-08): Valkey, Kafka, OpenObserve, Discovery, Processor
- **Configuration** (09): Fluent Bit parsers and settings
- **Operations** (10-11): Autoscaling and network policies

### 3. **Archived Unused Scripts**
- Moved 5 rarely-used scripts to `archive/` directory:
  - `deploy-with-fluent-bit.sh` (now default in main deploy)
  - `quick-start.sh` (simplified into deploy.sh)
  - `validate.sh` (old validation script)
  - Old versions of configmaps and processor

### 4. **Updated Core Scripts**
- `deploy.sh`: Now deploys Fluent Bit config by default
- `cleanup.sh`: Updated to match new file numbers
- `Makefile`: Simplified commands, added Fluent Bit logs
- `health-check.sh`: Works with new structure

### 5. **Improved Documentation**
- Simplified README with clear file structure table
- Updated command examples to reflect new organization
- Added troubleshooting section for Fluent Bit

## Benefits

1. **Easier Deployment**: Clear numbering shows deployment order
2. **Less Confusion**: No duplicate files with similar names
3. **Cleaner Directory**: Only essential files visible, extras archived
4. **Better Maintenance**: Logical grouping makes updates easier
5. **Production Ready**: Fluent Bit integration is now the default

## File Count Reduction

- **Before**: 18 files in main directory
- **After**: 17 files in main directory + 5 archived
- **Result**: Cleaner structure with all functionality preserved

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Deploy everything
./deploy.sh

# Or use Makefile
make deploy

# Check status
make status

# View logs
make logs      # Processor logs
make logs-fb   # Fluent Bit logs

# Clean up
make clean
```

All files are numbered in the exact order they should be applied, making manual deployment straightforward.
